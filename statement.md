# Practice with Loops

This Java template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```java runnable

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) {


int sum = 0;
for (int x = 1; x <= 15; x += 2) {
    sum += x;
}
System.out.println(sum);

}

}
```
